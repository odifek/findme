### The Concept

Just learning about Geofire and Location tracking, decided to do a simple person tracker. With the app, someone's location will be
reported continually to firebase. Another person with the client app could see the locations all people using the app in real time.
This is useful for things like ride sharing app, (intending customer can see the real time location of all available drivers)
